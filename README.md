## 🌐 API Server Integration

This app is a front-end client for the **CulinaryGPT Chatbot Server** (RAG-powered, Cohere-based), hosted on Vercel:

- **API Endpoint:**  
  `https://prog-7314-cohere-chatbot-server.vercel.app/prompt`
- **Health Check:**  
  `https://prog-7314-cohere-chatbot-server.vercel.app/health`
- **Analytics Dashboard:**  
  `https://prog-7314-cohere-chatbot-server.vercel.app/stats`

### 🔌 How it Works

- The Android app sends user questions to the `/prompt` endpoint as JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "prompt": "How do I make perfect pasta?"
  }
  ```
- The API server returns a structured response:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "To make perfect pasta, start with a large pot of salted water...",
    "citations": [
      { "start": 15, "end": 42, "document_id": "recipes_1" }
    ],
    "documentsUsed": 5,
    "categoriesReferenced": ["recipes", "techniques", "cooking_advice"]
  }
  ```
- The Android app displays the answer, including citations and advice.

### 🛡️ Server Features
